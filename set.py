# set() is a built-in function in Python that creates a set object, which is an unordered collection of unique elements.
# A set is a data structure that can store multiple values, but it does not allow duplicate values.


fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry","orange","kiwi","melon","mango"}
# fruits.add("pear") # to add an item
# fruits.remove("banana") # to remove an item
# fruits.discard("banana") # to remove an item
# fruits.pop() # to remove the last item
fruits.clear() # to clear the set
print(fruits)
