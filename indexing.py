# indexing indexing is a way to access the elements of an array []. It can be done in two ways:
credit_number = "1234-5678-9012-3456"

# print(credit_number[4]) 
print(credit_number[5:])  #start and end
print(credit_number[-1])  #last deigit
print(credit_number[::2])  #every second character within a string
